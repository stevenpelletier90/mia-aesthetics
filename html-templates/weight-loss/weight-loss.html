        At Mia Aesthetics, we believe in transparency when it comes to your treatments. Our Skinny
        Shots contain a powerful medication paired with pyridoxine—commonly known as
        <a href="/vitamin-b6-for-weight-loss/">vitamin B6</a>. B-vitamins act as lipotropes, helping
        your liver reduce fat production and storage. Additionally, vitamin B can provide an energy
        boost. Keep in mind that while the Skinny Shot is a helpful tool for weight loss, it works
        best when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise routine.

          Different doctors refer to different injections as “skinny shots,” and there is no
          industry standard for the term. A skinny shot could be anything from a vitamin injection
          to a prescription drug injection. Some doctors even claim to have their own special skinny
          shot cocktail.

        <p class="lead-lg">
          Weight loss is big business, which makes some doctors pretend they're hesitant to openly
          share their weight loss secrets and discoveries. The skinny on these skinny shots? Avoid
          them. You have a right to know exactly what is being injected into your body. Any
          practitioner who doesn't want to say too much is one you shouldn't be seeing. They could
          be injecting you with something as benign as saline solution or something potentially
          dangerous. If they feel the need to keep their trade secret, run - don't walk - out of
          their office.

      <article class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="section-heading section-heading--light mb-3">Vitamin B12</h2>
        <p class="lead-lg">
          Vitamin B12 is an important vitamin, and doctors sometimes inject it to help those with a
          vitamin deficiency avoid pernicious anemia. As such, a B12 boost can help you quite a bit
          if you've been feeling fatigued, but only if a B12 deficiency is the reason.
        </p>
        <p class="lead-lg">
          According to the Mayo Clinic, if your vitamin deficiency is severe enough to make you feel
          lethargic, you could gain weight as a result of reducing your exercise and movement. A
          lack of vitamin B12 doesn't directly lead to weight gain, however, so getting a B12
          injection alone won't cause you to lose weight — no matter how many times your doctor
          calls the injection a skinny shot.

      <article>
        <h2 class="section-heading section-heading--light mb-3">Lipotropic Injections (Lipo-C)</h2>
        <p class="lead-lg">
          Found in plant-based foods, lipotropes are chemicals that encourage the liver to get rid
          of fat. There are several different lipotropes, including B vitamins, methionine,
          <a href="/inositol-for-weight-loss/">inositol</a>, magnesium, niacin, and
          <a href="/choline-for-weight-loss/">choline</a>.
          <a href="/what-are-lipotropic-injections/">Lipotropic injections</a>, also frequently
          called Lipo-C injections, supposedly give the body a boost of these fat-burning
          lipotropes, the result of which is an increase in fat-burning and a decrease in weight.
          Providers often indicate that you'll need several shots each week although you may be able
          to slowly reduce shot frequency.
        </p>
        <p class="lead-lg mb-0">
          Unfortunately, there are a few problems with this particular skinny shot as well. One is
          that research has yet to prove Lipo-C injections safe or effective. As is true of the
          proprietary mixes discussed earlier, every clinic uses a different cocktail. Not every mix
          is suitable for every patient, and some clinics admit to adding phentermine to the mix,
          which is a prescription drug most known for its use many years ago as part of the
          controversial weight loss drug fen phen.

          Know What You're Getting
        </h2>
        <p class="lead-lg mb-0">
          If you’ve decided a skinny shot might be for you, the most important thing you can do is
          to know what you’re getting. Is that syringe full of B vitamins, lipotropes, phentermine,
          or something else? If you don’t know, don’t take it. And make sure you know before you go.
          Asking what’s in a skinny shot five minutes before you get it doesn’t give you any time to
          do the research you should. You should understand each ingredient in the shot and talk to
          your doctor about all of them to make sure they’re safe for you given your unique medical
          history and current medications.

          responsible for your skinny shot cocktail. Are you seeing a medical doctor or are you in a
          medical spa where your practitioner may not be a doctor at all? Are you in the hands of a
