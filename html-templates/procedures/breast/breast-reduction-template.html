          <h2>What Is a Breast Reduction?</h2>
          <div class="lead-text">
            <p>
              Breast reduction surgery is a cosmetic procedure that involves removing excess breast
              tissue and reshaping the breasts for a smaller, natural and youthful appearance. For a
              woman with breasts too large for her frame, back and neck pain, poor posture,
              difficulty exercising, trouble finding clothing that fits, and unwanted attention are
              often daily issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              Breast reduction surgery can offer these women lifelong relief by easing back pain and
              making everyday activities more comfortable and enjoyable.

          <h2>About the Breast Reduction Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            Breast reduction surgery can be done on an outpatient or inpatient basis, depending on
            the patient's individual needs and the extent of the surgery. The procedure is typically
            performed under general anesthesia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Incisions are usually made around the areola (skin surrounding the nipple), extending
            straight down to the bottom of the breast and ending horizontally in the breast crease,
            but incisions may be more limited in cases where less breast tissue needs to be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the incisions are made, the surgeon will remove excess breast gland, fat, and skin
            from each breast, shaping and lifting the breast throughout the process. Finally, the
            incisions will be closed with sutures.

          <h2>Breast Reduction Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Breast reduction patients heal at different rates, but most need to take between one and
            two weeks off of work for the initial healing period. Sutures are removed after the
            initial healing period. Immediately after the surgery, dressings are applied to the
            incision site and patients are required to wear a compression bra for as long as their
            surgeon advises to help aid in healing and reduce swelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swelling subsides over the weeks and months after surgery, and prescribed pain
            medication can help keep discomfort under control during this time. Exercise, bending,
            and lifting anything more than small or light objects must be avoided for at least a few
            weeks following surgery. Once the incisions have healed, patients can gradually resume
            normal activities, as allowed by surgeon instructions.
