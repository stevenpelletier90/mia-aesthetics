            <p>
              Breast implant revision surgery refers to a procedure performed to replace or remove
              breast implants from a previous breast augmentation. This surgery is typically
              undertaken to address issues with the initial implants, such as complications or
              dissatisfaction with the appearance.

      <h2>Why Might You Need a Breast Implant Revision?</h2>
      <p>
        There are several reasons you could decide to undergo a breast implant surgery revision.
        Some are cosmetic, but others may be related to pain or discomfort. Reasons for breast
        implant revisions include:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Capsular Contracture:</strong> Capsular contracture is when the scar tissue
              that naturally forms around the implant hardens, tightening and compressing the
              implant. Sometimes painful, capsular contracture can misshape the implant and make it
              feel hard.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Implant Rupture or Deflation:</strong> Saline implants can sometimes leak, and
              when they do they often deflate and flatten. Although rare, silicone implants can
              rupture and require replacement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Implant Rippling:</strong> Visible wrinkles or ripples on the implant surface
              can occur, which may be felt or seen through the skin. This tends to happen when large
              implants are placed in small bodies that lack enough tissue to properly cover the
              implant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Size Modification:</strong> Sometimes the patient rethinks their decision as
              far as implant size. A revision can increase or decrease the size of the implants as
              desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asymmetry Correction:</strong> If there is significant asymmetry between the
              breasts post-augmentation, revision might be needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="content-wrapper">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Symmastia Correction:</strong> Symmastia is a condition in which the breasts
              touch in the center of the chest, creating what is colloquially referred to as a
              "uniboob." (Think unibrow but on your chest.) Breast augmentation revisions can fix
              this issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Breast Sagging:</strong> Large implants are heavy and may cause the breasts to
              sag more than expected. Sometimes sagging is due to the fact that age and time don't
              stop affecting the breasts after an augmentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Implant Type Change:</strong> Sometimes patients want to change the type of
              implant they selected, often going from saline to silicone for a more natural feel.
              Other patients may wish to change from a textured implant to a smooth one or vice
              versa.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Post-Pregnancy Changes:</strong> Getting pregnant and breastfeeding after a
              breast augmentation are both perfectly safe but may result in unfavorable changes to
              the breasts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pain Alleviation:</strong> Some women may experience pain due to scarring,
              implant position, or other issues. In this case, implant revisions or removals are
              performed to alleviate the discomfort.

          <h2>How the Procedure Works</h2>
          <p>
            Because revision surgery is done to correct a specific problem or address a concern,
            every surgery is different. Here's a detailed overview of each stage to help understand
            what typically happens during a breast implant revision procedure:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>The Meeting of the Minds:</strong> You and your surgeon or surgical
              coordinator will have a detailed discussion about the issues with your breast implants
              and your desired outcome. Your surgical options will be discussed as well as any
              limitations or special factors that may affect your surgery and expected results.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Preoperative Preparation:</strong> Your surgeon will likely send you for blood
              tests or other lab work before your surgery to verify that surgery is safe for you. An
              MRI or ultrasound may also be ordered to get a better look at your existing breast
              implants. Your surgeon may also ask for permission to contact your original surgeon to
              get information about your initial breast augmentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Surgery:</strong> On the big day you will be placed under general
              anesthesia for maximum comfort during your procedure. To begin, the surgeon will make
              any necessary incisions, using the same lines as your previous surgeon whenever
              possible to minimize additional scarring. Your old implants will be removed, and any
              necessary modifications to the breast pocket made, which may include scar tissue
              removal or reshaping of the capsule that holds the implant. If applicable, new
              implants are inserted and your incisions closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Postoperative Care:</strong> After surgery, you will be taken to a recovery
              area where vital signs are monitored as the anesthesia wears off. Pain relief
              medications will be administered and instructions for managing pain at home provided.
              When you have sufficiently recovered from the anesthesia, you will be sent home to
              begin your recovery. You can expect to be off work for at least a week and have your
              exercise and activity levels restricted for up to eight weeks.

          <h2>How We Reduce Potential Complications</h2>
          <p>
            We pride ourselves on using advanced surgical techniques to reduce potential
            complications in breast implant revision surgeries and improve outcomes. We start by
            utilizing advanced imaging technologies like MRI and 3D ultrasound to give our surgeons
            the best views of existing breast implants and the surrounding tissue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever possible, we also take minimally invasive approaches to minimize tissue
            disruption and speed recovery. Strategic placement of incisions, either by using
            existing scar tissue or through less visible areas, reduces scarring and potential
            complications associated with wound healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, we also use the newest proven implant technologies, like highly cohesive
            silicone gel implants, to lower rates of rupture and leakage. We also use textured
            implants when appropriate to reduce the risk of capsular contracture and excessive scar
            tissue.

          <h2>Post-Surgery Scarring Expectations</h2>
          <p>
            Your surgical coordinator will discuss the specifics of your case, including the
            potential for scarring, with you prior to your surgery. Whenever possible, your surgeon
            will hide your incision in your areolas or cut along your current implant scars to avoid
            making a new one. Scars can also be hidden in the crease beneath the breasts sometimes.
            If you opt for a breast lift as part of your revision surgery, you may have a vertical
            scar that runs from your areola down to the breast crease.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to remember that scars do fade over time, especially with proper skin and
            scar care. Plastic surgeons are aware that scarring is a concern and always conceal
            scars whenever possible. It's important, however, that you don't let a fear of scarring
            prevent you from getting a surgery that could alleviate pain or discomfort that is
            disrupting your daily life.
