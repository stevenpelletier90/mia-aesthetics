          <h2>What is Breast Augmentation?</h2>
          <div class="lead-text">
            <p>
              Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure that involves placing synthetic implants
              into the chest to enhance the volume and appearance of breasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The procedure, which is sought out by over 300,000 American women a year, is typically
              done to increase breast size or improve breast symmetry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The outcome of breast augmentation varies based on the desires of each surgery
              candidate - some patients want a dramatic increase in breast size, while others opt to
              maintain a more natural appearance. The choice is yours and entirely customizable.

      <h2>Two Types of Breast Implants</h2>
      <p>
        There are two types of implants available for women considering a breast augmentation. Each
        offers unique benefits and drawbacks and should be chosen based on the patient's surgery
        goals

          <p>
            Filled with a sterile salt water solution, saline implants are among the safest types of
            implants. If a saline implant ruptures or leaks, it will simply be absorbed into the
            body without harm.

          <h3>Silicone Gel</h3>
          <p>
            These implants have a silicone outer shell that is filled with silicone gel. They come
            in different sizes and have either smooth or textured shells. Many women opt for soft
            silicone implants because of their natural look and feel.

          <h2>About Breast Augmentation</h2>
          <p>
            Breast augmentation is an outpatient procedure performed under general anesthesia.
            Incisions are made either around the areola (skin surrounding the nipple), underneath
            the breast (in the crease) or through the armpit. Each incision site is designed to
            minimize visible
            <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/breast/augmentation-implants/scars/">scarring</a>.
            Once the incision is made, the implant will be placed either over or
            <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/breast/augmentation-implants/under-the-muscle/"
              >under</a
            >
            the chest muscles, an aspect of the procedure that you will discuss with your surgeon
            prior to the operation. Once the implants are in place, the incisions will be closed
            with sutures and/or tape. The procedure usually takes between one and three hours to
            complete.

          <h2>Breast Augmentation Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            After undergoing a breast augmentation, patients will need to take a few days or more
            off from work depending on whether or not their occupation involves strenuous activity.
            Patients will need to refrain from vigorous

            and lifting heavy objects for the first few weeks following surgery and should strictly
            follow surgeon guidelines for incision care and resuming everyday activities â€“this will
            help speed along a successful recovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the procedure, patients may also be fitted with compression or support
            garments to help with healing and reduce inflammation. Patients should expect some
