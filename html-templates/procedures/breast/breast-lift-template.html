          <h2>What is a Breast Lift?</h2>
          <div class="lead-text">
            <p>
              Breast lift is a surgical procedure that shapes and raises the breasts to create a
              perky, youthful appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Genetics, ageing, breastfeeding and pregnancy, weight loss and weight gain, or a
              combination of factors can all contribute to the appearance of drooping breasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Breast lift is a reliable way to turn back the hands of time and get the vibrant,
              youthful physique you crave.

          <h2>About The Breast Lift Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            Breast lift surgery is typically an outpatient procedure performed under general
            anesthesia. There are several incision patterns your doctor can use around the breasts
            depending on the amount of lift required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The surgeons at Mia Aesthetics will always opt for the most minimal incision pattern
            possible, as long as it allows for your desired end results. The first type of incision
            is isolated around the areola (the skin surrounding the nipple) and is very discreet.
            This is used for breast lifts that require only subtle adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more extensive lifts, an incision extending down from the areola may be added. For
            very extensive lifts, another incision may be added underneath the breasts, close to the
            breast crease. Once the incisions are made, excess skin will be removed and tightened,
            and the breast will be contoured and supported for a lifted, perky, shapely appearance.
          </p>

            <p class="mb-0">
              <i class="fa-solid fa-info-circle"></i>
              Once the breast is shaped, the nipple and areola will be repositioned to maintain a
              natural appearance and the incisions will be closed.

          <h2>Breast Lift Recovery</h2>
          <p>
            Following a breast lift, surgical sutures stay in place for an average of seven to 10
            days and dressings will be put in place. A compression bra will also need to be worn for
            several weeks to help the incisions heal. Initial recovery lasts about one to two weeks,
            after which normal activities and non-strenuous work can slowly be resumed. Prescription
            pain medication can relieve discomfort and swelling during the recovery period. Lifting,
            strenuous exercise, and other high-impact activities must be suspended for at least
            several additional weeks, per surgeon's instructions. Soreness and swelling will slowly
            subside over the weeks and months following surgery. It is important that patients
            follow all surgeon instructions during healing to help ensure the best results and
            prevent complications. For a deeper understanding of what to expect, visit our
