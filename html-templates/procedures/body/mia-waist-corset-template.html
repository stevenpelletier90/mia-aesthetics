          <h2>What is Rib Repositioning?</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes called rib remodeling, rib repositioning is a surgical procedure that changes
            the position of the bottom ribs without removing them. Doing so adds definition to the
            waist and gives the midsection a more sculpted look. It helps to create the desirable
            but often elusive hourglass figure.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Mia Aesthetics, rib remodeling is not done as a standalone procedure. It is instead
            offered as an additional option to those having
            <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/lipo-360/">lipo 360</a>, a
            <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/brazilian-butt-lift-bbl/">BBL</a>, or a
            <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/tummy-tuck/">tummy tuck</a>.

          <h2>Safer and More Effective Than Rib Removal</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to creating a narrow waist, rib repositioning and rib removal create very
            similar results. Rib repositioning, however, is much less likely to result in
            complications, and our top priority is always keeping you safe. Rib removal, for
            example, can create chest wall instability and reduce the amount of protection that your
            rib cage can afford your internal organs. It can also weaken your core structure and
            impair lung function. These complications themselves are permanent and can lead to other
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rib remodeling is able to provide comparable results without the long-term
            complications. Your waistline will be greatly improved, but your ribs will still be
            there to protect your internal organs and stabilize your core.

          <h2>How Rib Repositioning Works</h2>
          <p>
            Performed as an outpatient surgery, rib remodeling changes the position of your bottom
            two ribs. These ribs are called floating ribs because they aren't attached to your
            sternum like your other ribs.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the procedure, your surgeon will access these ribs through small incisions that
            are about the same size as liposuction incisions (two to three mm). As always, they will
            hide these incisions in the natural contours of the body as much as possible. Through
            these incisions your surgeon will carefully dissect the muscles and soft tissue to
            expose the ribs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once they have exposed them, surgeons gently reposition the ribs to reduce rib flare and
            slim the waistline. This involves surgically fracturing the ribs so they can be
            relocated. Fracturing is done in a very precise and controlled manner to produce the
            desired outcome without damaging any underlying structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            After repositioning the ribs, your surgeon may use sutures, wires, or other devices as
            needed to hold the ribs in place as they heal. These fixation methods are typically made
            from materials that will dissolve and be absorbed by the body over time.
