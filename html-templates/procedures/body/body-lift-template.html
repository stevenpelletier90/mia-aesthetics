              A circumferential body lift, also known as a lower body lift or a belt lipectomy, is a
              comprehensive cosmetic surgery that aims to reshape and tighten the mid and lower body
              by removing excess skin and fat. This procedure is particularly beneficial for
              individuals who have experienced significant weight loss, such as after bariatric
              surgery, and are left with loose, hanging skin around their abdomen, hips, thighs, and
              buttocks.

                A lower body lift and
                <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/liposuction/">liposuction</a>
                are two very different procedures with little in common. Liposuction removes excess
                fat but does nothing to address loose or sagging skin. A lower body lift removes
                both excess fat and skin, resulting in a more thorough procedure. Liposuction is a
                more subtle procedure, intended to sculpt and reshape parts of the body without
                removing large amounts of tissue.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                A lower body lift always targets the body's midsection. Liposuction, however, can be
                performed almost anywhere on the body.
                <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/lipo-360/">Lipo 360</a>
                is the most similar liposuction procedure to a lower body lift.

              Because every person is different, every lower body lift may be slightly different.
              The procedure generally follows these basic steps, however:
            </p>
            <ol class="how-it-works-list">
              <li>
                Your surgical team will prepare you for surgery and then place you under general
                anesthesia.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your procedure will begin with your surgeon making an incision around the entire
                circumference of your body. You can think of this incision wrapping around you like
                a belt.
              </li>
              <li>The surgeon will cut away any excess skin and fat as necessary.</li>
              <li>
                After the excess skin and fat are removed, your surgeon will fine tune the remaining
                tissue, tightening the muscles as necessary to strengthen and smooth the remaining
                structures.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your surgeon will lift the remaining skin and pull it taut over your new body
                contours before suturing the incision closed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your surgical team will bandage your incisions as needed and place you in a
                compression garment. They will then wake you from anesthesia and take you to the
                recovery room for monitoring as you wake up.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you have sufficiently awoken from anesthesia, your driver can take you home.
                Lower body lifts are performed as outpatient procedures at Mia Aesthetics.
