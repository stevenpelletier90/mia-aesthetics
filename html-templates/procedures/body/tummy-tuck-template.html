              A tummy tuck, also known as abdominoplasty, is a popular procedure that removes excess
              fat and skin from the abdominal area, and for many patients, tightens and restores the
              stomach muscles to their former shape and positioning.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5">
              Benefits of a tummy tuck include a smoother, firmer midsection with improved overall
              contour. There are variations on the tummy tuck, and the procedure is customized to
              suit each patient's specific needs. The basic tummy tuck involves working with the
              abdominal section from the bottom of the rib cage up to the hip.

          <p class="mb-3">
            The classic tummy tuck is performed under general anesthesia and is done on an
            outpatient basis, allowing patients to return home the same day.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            An incision is made from hip to hip in a full tummy tuck, strategically placed to hide
            beneath underwear or a bikini bottom. Once the incision is made, excess, stretched out
            skin is removed, and the remaining skin is tightened.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Liposuction (also known as lipo) is also commonly performed in the flanks during a tummy
            tuck to remove excess fat. Lastly, the abdominal muscles will be rejoined and tightened
            before the incisions are closed and sutures are placed.

          <p class="mb-3">
            A tummy tuck recovery takes time, and patients should expect to devote at least one to
            two weeks strictly for resting and healing. Expect pain and discomfort, particularly if
            the procedure involves muscle tightening. Pain medications will help keep patients
            comfortable during recovery time.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            Following the procedure, drain tubes may be inserted to prevent fluid from accumulating
            in the abdomen. These are removed in a follow-up visit one to two weeks following
            surgery. Post-operation, patients must wear a special compression garment for several
            weeks to aid in swelling and bruising, which will subside over a few weeks.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            Most people find they can return to work after about a week, but some may need more
            recovery time. While everyday activities can be gradually re-introduced after the first
            week or two following surgery, vigorous exercise must be avoided for four to six weeks.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-3">
            As swelling subsides, patients will begin to see the results of their tummy tuck emerge.
