        <p class="fs-5 mb-3">
          The Brazilian butt lift (BBL), sculpts the buttocks and adds volume using the patient's
          own fat from other areas of the body. No matter the patient's age, genetics, or other
          factors, butt enhancement can lift, tighten, and improve the overall appearance of the
          buttocks.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          The BBL procedure has recently become the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery in the nation,
          according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

            <p class="mb-3">
              The Brazilian butt lift is usually performed as an outpatient surgery under general
              anesthesia. The first step in the procedure is the extraction of fat from one or more
              donor areas. These areas may include the stomach, hips or thighs, and will depend on
              the amount of fat needed and the distribution of fat throughout the body.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Liposuction is performed through small incisions, removing excess fat from the donor
              areas to ensure there is enough fat for grafting. Once the fat is retrieved, it is
              washed, spun, and purified to isolate the most viable cells for transfer. About 25
              percent of cells will be healthy enough to reuse. The prepared fat is then injected
              into the buttock area, carefully shaping, lifting and augmenting the area according to
              the patient's wishes.

              Because treatment centers around a high-movement area, recovery after a Brazilian butt
              lift involves significant activity restrictions. Patients should plan to take up to
              two weeks off of work, and possibly more if their works involves a lot of sitting.
              Patients should wear compression garments for three to six months following the
              procedure.

            <p class="mb-0">
              Post-surgical pain and discomfort can be controlled with prescribed medication. Final
              results become apparent at about six months to a year after surgery after swelling
              subsides and the fat establishes itself in the buttock area.

            <p class="mb-3">
              Like all surgeries, a BBL is usually followed by some discomfort. Many patients report
              some mild to moderate soreness in their buttocks and at the liposuction sites after
              the procedure. Buttock pain is often compared to muscle soreness. It typically
              subsides within 48 hours of surgery and is generally not difficult to cope with.
              Post-surgical pain and discomfort are controlled with prescribed medication which will
              keep you comfortable as you recover.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              If you still have some mild discomfort after finishing your prescribed medication,
              over-the-counter pain relievers such as Tylenol usually prove more than adequate at
              resolving the issue. There is no reason for you to fear that a BBL will leave you in
              excessive pain or discomfort. Severe pain or pain that increases rather than decreases
              indicate a complication you should immediately report to us.
