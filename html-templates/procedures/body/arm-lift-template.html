              Arm lift, also known as brachioplasty, is a surgical procedure that removes excess
              skin and fat from the upper arms, thus tightening skin and making muscle tone more
              visible. Once the excess tissue is gone, patients will enjoy sleeker, slimmer and more
              aesthetically pleasing upper arms.

              Arm lift surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia on an outpatient
              basis, allowing patients to go home shortly after the procedure is complete. An
              incision will be made on the underside of the upper arm, through which your surgeon
              will remove excess skin and fatty tissue to sculpt the arm into an aesthetically
              pleasing shape. The length of the incision will depend on how much tissue needs to be
              removed. Once this is done, the skin will be tightened, and the incision closed with
              sutures. Sometimes, patients will need liposuction (commonly referred to as lipo) in
              combination with arm lift surgery. If this is the case, the liposuction will be
              performed at the same time as the brachioplasty. Arm lift surgery takes between one
              and two hours.

              Immediately following an arm lift, your surgeon will bandage surgical incisions and
              advise that you wear a compression garment to reduce swelling. Patients should be able
              to manage any pain and discomfort with prescribed medications, and most feel well
              enough to return to work within a week. Patients should expect some activity
              restrictions for several weeks following surgery, and should follow any special
              instructions the surgeon provides to allow for proper healing.
