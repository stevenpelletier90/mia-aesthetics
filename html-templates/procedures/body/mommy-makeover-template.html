        <h2 class="display-3 mb-4">What is a Mommy Makeover?</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">You adore your children, but you may not feel the same about the ways your body has changed since having them. If you want your pre-mommy body back, we can help.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The mommy makeover addresses body and skin concerns that often occur in women who have carried one or more babies. After having children, many women experience undesirable body changes such
          as weight gain, skin stretching, and breast sagging. The mommy makeover addresses all of these issues in a single surgery.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          A classic mommy makeover involves a tummy tuck and breast lift or augmentation, but it can be whatever you want. We can fully customize your procedure, combining whatever surgeries you'd
          like so long as your surgeon feels they're safe to do together.

            <p>
              Technically, any procedures you want that are safe to combine can be included in a mommy makeover. While the specific procedures included will vary depending on your individual needs and
              goals, some of the most common ones include:
            </p>
            <ul class="procedures-list">
              <li>
                <a class="fixed-bg-link" href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/breast/augmentation-implants/"><strong>Breast Augmentation</strong></a>
                – Some women find that they have lost a cup size when they stop breastfeeding and their milk supply dries up. A breast augmentation can help reverse this effect.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a class="fixed-bg-link" href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/breast/lift/"><strong>Breast Lift</strong></a>
                – While some women find that their chest shrinks after breastfeeding, other women have the opposite problem. Pregnancy causes weight gain and swelling in the breasts, and sometimes the
                ligaments are just stretched too far to recover. A breast lift can help put the girls back up where they belong.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a class="fixed-bg-link" href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/tummy-tuck/"><strong>Tummy Tuck</strong></a>
                – Pregnancy doesn't just stretch the skin on your stomach—it can also permanently split the muscles of your abdominal wall. No amount of exercise can fix that, but a tummy tuck can.
                This procedure tightens the abdominal muscles, removes excess skin, and creates a flatter, more toned stomach.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a class="fixed-bg-link" href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/liposuction/"><strong>Liposuction</strong></a>
                and Lipo 360 – It's healthy to gain some weight during pregnancy, but it's nice when it goes away after you deliver. Unfortunately, you may have gained some fat where you don't want it
                and it may not be going away. Liposuction can remove unwanted fat from almost anywhere, including the abdomen, flanks, back, and thighs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a class="fixed-bg-link" href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/brazilian-butt-lift-bbl/"><strong>Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL)</strong></a>
                – Pregnancy changes almost everything, and that includes your backside. As your size changed during pregnancy, you may not have exercised as much or at all. Even if you did, you likely
                changed the exercises you did. Your belly may even have changed the way you walked. All of this can alter the muscles in and shape of your backside. A BBL can give you back some of the
                curves you may have lost.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="display-3 mb-4">Mommy Makeover Recovery</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
          The specifics of your recovery will depend on which procedures you elect to undergo. Generally, however, patients can drive in one week, walk five miles on a flat surface in two weeks, and
          run after four weeks. Some women will feel ready to return to work after just one week, but most women need two to four weeks of recovery time before returning to work.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          You should not lift more than five pounds during the first three to four weeks after breast surgery, and following a tummy tuck, avoid twisting motions and using your core for four to six
          weeks.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          Compression garments and prescribed medication will be provided to reduce pain and swelling post-operatively. Make sure to enlist support to help with daily activities and childcare, as you
          will likely be very tired the first few weeks following surgery.
