              Awake liposuction is a minimally invasive procedure where the patient is awake during
              the surgery. If you want liposuction but the thought of going under general anesthesia
              makes you nervous, awake liposuction might be perfect for you. Awake liposuction
              provides a faster recovery since general anesthesia is not needed.

            <p class="mb-3">
              Awake liposuction essentially works the same way as traditional liposuction except
              that you aren't asleep during the procedure. Your surgeon will use sedatives and local
              anesthesia to keep you comfortable during this minimally invasive surgery.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              When you're ready, the surgeon will carefully pass a cannula into your body through
              small incisions and then further numb the area with a tumescent solution, which is a
              local anesthetic that reduces pain and bleeding. They will then remove any unwanted
              fat. Liposuction is a body contouring procedure, so your surgeon will shape and sculpt
              the body, removing fat strategically to get the desired body shape.

            <p class="mb-3">
              Because you're not asleep during this type of liposuction, your surgeon can talk to
              you during your procedure. This can result in better results since your surgeon can
              ask you to flex specific muscles or move into a certain position. This can help them
              sculpt your body more effectively, allowing them to see certain aspects of their work
              more clearly as they sculpt and contour your body. This can result in a better
              finished product.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Awake liposuction is also less risky because local anesthesia poses fewer risks than
              general anesthesia. It also lets you get back to life more quickly. You will have to
              take it easy and rest after your liposuction, of course, but skipping general
              anesthesia means avoiding feeling groggy and disconnected for hours after your
              surgery. General anesthesia can stay in your body for up to 24 hours after your
              procedure, affecting you much longer than a local anesthetic.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Awake liposuction also utilizes tumescent fluid. This mixture of fluids and lidocaine
              not only helps numb the area but also makes the fat swell, making it easier to remove.
              The result is less swelling and bruising after the procedure. This makes recovery
              faster and easier.

              The best candidates for awake liposuction are nonsmokers who are generally healthy and
              close to their ideal body weight. But there is a lot more wiggle room in the criteria
              for awake liposuction than there is for traditional liposuction. Patients with a BMI
              of 40 who aren't good candidates for general anesthesia are eligible for awake
              liposuction. They may need multiple surgical sessions to achieve ideal results, but
              awake liposuction is an option for many who would otherwise be denied liposuction
              surgery.
