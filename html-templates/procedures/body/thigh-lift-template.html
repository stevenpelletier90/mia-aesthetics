        <p class="fs-5 mb-0">
          Thigh lift surgery is a solution to sagging thigh skin. The procedure helps redefine,
          tighten and re-contour the thighs and lower body. Benefits of a thigh lift are improved
          contour and smoother, tighter skin on the thighs. Patients feel more confident wearing
          shorts or skirts and typically experience a significant boost in self-esteem.

              Many thigh lift procedures are performed on an outpatient basis, allowing patients to
              return home the day of surgery. General anesthesia is used during the procedure. Step
              one is the incision, which may be placed in different areas depending on the amount of
              contouring and tightening required. Many incisions start in the groin area and extend
              to the buttocks or down the legs. Typically, the longer the incision, the easier it is
              to tighten the skin and contour the thigh. To avoid scarring, plastic surgeons will
              make the incision as short as possible. Once the incision is made, excess skin (and
              fat, if necessary) is removed, and the remaining skin is tightened and contoured to
              improve the overall shape of the thighs. Support sutures may be used to help shape and
              hold the tissues as well.

              Immediately after surgery, dressings are placed over your wounds. Patients will be
              given compression garments to provide support and reduce swelling throughout the
              healing process.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              In some cases, temporary drain tubes may be placed for a week or so. Patients should
              wait one to three weeks before returning to everyday activities, depending on the
              extent of the procedure and the patient's unique healing speed.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Patients can speed up the process and improve the outcome of the surgery by following
              all surgeon instructions for aftercare.
