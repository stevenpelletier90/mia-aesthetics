              Labiaplasty, also known as labia reduction or vaginal rejuvenation, reshapes the
              external appearance of the genitalia for both cosmetic reasons and to treat any
              functional impairment. The procedure often increases hygiene and symmetry of the
              labia, leading to increased comfort and confidence for patients.

              The Labiaplasty/Vaginal Rejuvenation Procedure

              On surgery day, labiaplasty patients will receive a mild sedative followed by general
              anesthesia.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              The surgeon will make an incision on the labia major or minor and cut away the excess
              tissue, suturing the wound afterward. The surgeon then applies an anesthetic solution
              over the labia. The operation typically lasts one hour, and after about an hour or two
              of rest, patients are permitted to go home. Patients should arrange for someone to
              drive them home.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">There are five different ways to conduct labiaplasty surgery:</p>
            <ul class="mb-0">
              <li class="mb-2">
                <strong>Edge Resection:</strong> In this procedure, the doctor surgically removes
                excess skin from the edges of the labia minora.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                <strong>Central Wedge Resection:</strong> This method involves the cutting and
                removing of wedged tissue from the thickest segment of the labia minora. This
                technique preserves the natural wrinkles of the labia minora but has a greater
                margin of error than some other labiaplasty techniques.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                <strong>De-epithelialization:</strong> This technique involves cutting the surface
                tissue of the labia minora. The surgeon cuts around the middle and back part of the
                labia tissues with either a scalpel or a laser beam. This technique maintains the
                wrinkles and sensations of the labia but may increase the width of the labium.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-2">
                <strong>Labiaplasty with Clitoral Unhooding:</strong> In this technique, the
                clitoral hood gets resected. The doctor sutures the hood in a V pattern and shapes
                the skin to form a Y shape, uncovering the clitoral hood and tightening the labia
                tissue.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-0">
                <strong>Laser Labiaplasty:</strong> This technique combines de-epithelialization and
                the use of laser beams instead of a scalpel. The only disadvantage to this technique
                is that the laser may remove too much skin in the process.

          <p class="mb-0">
            A patient can return to work a week after labiaplasty â€“ the simpler the procedure, the
            shorter the recovery time. Strenuous work should be avoided for at least a month, and
            intercourse should be avoided for six weeks following surgery. On the first day post-op,
            the patient should stay in bed and arrange for a caretaker to look after them. During
            the recovery period, the surgeon must check up periodically to see how the wound
            recovers and if any further revision is required. If the patient menstruates during her
            recovery time, she must not wear tampons. Restrictive clothing or thong underwear should
            also be avoided during recovery. Post-op swelling usually lasts between one and four
            months. For a more in-depth breakdown, take a look at our
