            <p class="fs-5 mb-0">
              Medically known as a platysmaplasty, a neck lift is a surgical tool used to correct
              wrinkles and sagging skin on the neck. These common signs of aging often create a
              condition that is less-than-lovingly referred to as a turkey neck. While a neck lift
              does address excess fat and skin, it also tightens a muscle in the neck known as the
              platysma muscle. This muscle becomes weaker and thinner as you age, which is often the
              underlying cause of a sagging neck. Added bonusâ€”a neck lift can also eliminate the
              dreaded double chin.

              About The Neck Lift Procedure

              The surgeons at Mia Aesthetics perform neck lifts as outpatient procedures under
              general anesthesia. You won't be allowed to drive yourself home because of the
              anesthesia, however, so you will need to have someone bring you to your surgery. A
              neck lift can take anywhere from one to four hours, so your ride will definitely want
              to bring a book!
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Now that your ride knows what to expect, you should too. After you are prepped for
              surgery and drift off to sleep under anesthesia, your neck lift will proceed as
              follows:
            </p>
            <ol class="mb-4">
              <li class="mb-3">
                Your surgeon will make a small incision behind each ear and, depending on your
                needs, may also make a third incision beneath your chin.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Through these incisions, your surgeon will tighten the neck muscles and the
                underlying tissue.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Excess skin and fat will be removed as needed to recontour and shape the neck.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-4">
                Your remaining skin will be pulled taut over your neck and then your incisions
                closed.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Although a neck lift is generally very safe, there are always risks to major surgery.
              Choosing the right surgeon and following all pre-and post-operative instructions will
              greatly reduce the risk of complications.
