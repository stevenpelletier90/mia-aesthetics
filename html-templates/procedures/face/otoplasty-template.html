              Otoplasty is a cosmetic surgery that corrects protruding or deformed ears by fixing
              abnormalities in the ear structure. It repositions, resizes and/or reshapes the ears.
              In some cases, otoplasty also goes by the name "ear pinning."

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Although the exact surgical technique used will depend on several factors, the basics of
            otoplasty remain the same: First, incisions are made in the ear and used to remove extra
            fat and skin. Second, the cartilage is contoured and positioned for optimal aesthetics.
            And lastly, the incisions are closed with stitches.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            In most cases, the surgery is performed while the patient is under general anesthesia.
            When ear surgery is performed on children, the ear cartilage is very soft, allowing for
            contouring with splints. Adults have much harder cartilage, so the procedure will
            consist of repositioning or removing cartilage through a small ear incision.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Depending on your desired changes and unique anatomy, your surgeon may decide to make an
            incision hidden behind the ear. During the procedure, extra soft tissue or cartilage
            that causes the ear to stick out can be removed. If the ear is missing its normal folds,
            your doctor can shape the cartilage and create these folds. In many situations, the
            folds can be created with permanent sutures, or the cartilage can be contoured through
            targeted shaving. Depending on the desired result and the initial complications, your
            surgeon might use multiple techniques.

            Bandages are placed around the head after surgery to keep the ears in place, protect
            them and help them heal. The initial bandage will typically get swapped out with a
            lighter bandage within a few days. Patients should keep their head elevated for the
            first few days and rest as much as possible. Any discomfort can be well-controlled by
            prescribed medication. There will be some swelling, which will recede over the next
            weeks and months. Most patients can go back to work or school in a week or two,
            gradually resuming normal activities.
