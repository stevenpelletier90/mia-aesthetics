              Facelifts remove and tighten excess skin and reposition fat deposits and muscles that
              have sagged or warped over time. Facelift procedures can remove deep-set wrinkles,
              sagging jowls, fatty deposits or banding on the face and neck. This is accomplished by
              removing or repositioning fat to areas which will fill in wrinkled or sagging skin, as
              well as reducing and tightening skin around the lower jaw.

              Facelifts fall into several categories: Full, lower, and mini lifts:

            <p class="mb-0">
              A full facelift is the most complex type of facelift because it is a combination of
              separate procedures that work together to rejuvenate the overall appearance of the
              face. Because everyone ages differently, the procedures that work for one person could
              be completely inappropriate for another. The surgeries generally included in a full
              facelift target the lower face, mid-face and neck.

            <p class="mb-0">
              Lower facelifts target only the lower portion of the face and are used to sculpt the
              skin and tissue around the mouth, jaw and neck. Lower facelifts help to remove the
              signs of weariness and falsely expressed emotions (sadness, anger, fatigue) which can
              look permanent on aging skin.

            <h4 class="text-gold mb-3">Mini Facelifts</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Mini facelifts generally involve a single incision site along the ear. This tiny
              S-shaped incision is designed to be virtually invisible once healed. Also known as the
              "weekend facelift," this procedure is popular among women aged 40-50 who have only
              just begun to show signs of aging. Skin that has severe deep wrinkles and signs of
              aging would not generally benefit much from a mini facelift.

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            General anesthesia is almost always used for full facelifts so that patients are
            unconscious and immobile for surgery. Local anesthesia combined with sedation may be
            used for less complicated procedures such as lower or mini facelifts. In this instance,
            the area surrounding the surgical site will be numbed and you will receive intravenous
            sedation to relax you and keep your body still. You may fall asleep as a result of the
            sedation, but many patients remain awake throughout their procedures.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            The surgeon will make incisions necessary to access the targeted areas of the face.
            Through these incisions, the doctor will reposition and tighten the facial muscles and
            skin for a smooth, youthful appearance. Fat may be repositioned to fill in facial
            hollows and promote symmetry. Excess skin and fat will be removed before the incisions
            are closed and dressings are applied.

          <p class="mb-3">
            Swelling, bruising and bleeding at the incision sites are typical after a facelift.
            Patients should focus on resting with their head elevated for the first week after
            surgery to maximize healing and prevent unnecessary strain on the body.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Initially, patients may have a surgical drain placed at the incision site to reduce
            swelling. This drain must be emptied and reset frequently to prevent a fluid buildup.
            Drains are typically removed a few days after surgery. The sutures will either dissolve
            in a couple of weeks or be removed along with any drains.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Most patients return to office jobs within one to two weeks following surgery, depending
            on the extent of the facelift. Bending, lifting and strenuous exercise will be
            off-limits for several weeks following a facelift. Patients should take great care to
            follow all recovery instructions to enhance the results of the procedure and help
            prevent complications.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Swelling will subside over the weeks and months following surgery and patients can
            expect to see final results in about six months to a year. Preliminary results will be
            visible after about six to eight weeks.
