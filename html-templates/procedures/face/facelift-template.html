              Facelifts remove and tighten excess skin and reposition fat deposits and muscles that have sagged or warped over time. Facelift procedures can remove deep-set wrinkles, sagging jowls,
              fatty deposits or banding on the face and neck. This is accomplished by removing or repositioning fat to areas which will fill in wrinkled or sagging skin, as well as reducing and
              tightening skin around the lower jaw.

            <p class="mb-0">
              A full facelift is the most complex type of facelift because it is a combination of separate procedures that work together to rejuvenate the overall appearance of the face. Because
              everyone ages differently, the procedures that work for one person could be completely inappropriate for another. The surgeries generally included in a full facelift target the lower
              face, mid-face and neck.

            <p class="mb-0">
              Lower facelifts target only the lower portion of the face and are used to sculpt the skin and tissue around the mouth, jaw and neck. Lower facelifts help to remove the signs of weariness
              and falsely expressed emotions (sadness, anger, fatigue) which can look permanent on aging skin.

            <h4 class="text-gold mb-3">Mini Facelifts</h4>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Mini facelifts generally involve a single incision site along the ear. This tiny S-shaped incision is designed to be virtually invisible once healed. Also known as the "weekend
              facelift," this procedure is popular among women aged 40-50 who have only just begun to show signs of aging. Skin that has severe deep wrinkles and signs of aging would not generally
              benefit much from a mini facelift.

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            General anesthesia is almost always used for full facelifts so that patients are unconscious and immobile for surgery. Local anesthesia combined with sedation may be used for less
            complicated procedures such as lower or mini facelifts. In this instance, the area surrounding the surgical site will be numbed and you will receive intravenous sedation to relax you and
            keep your body still. You may fall asleep as a result of the sedation, but many patients remain awake throughout their procedures.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            The surgeon will make incisions necessary to access the targeted areas of the face. Through these incisions, the doctor will reposition and tighten the facial muscles and skin for a
            smooth, youthful appearance. Fat may be repositioned to fill in facial hollows and promote symmetry. Excess skin and fat will be removed before the incisions are closed and dressings are
            applied.

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Swelling, bruising and bleeding at the incision sites are typical after a facelift. Patients should focus on resting with their head elevated for the first week after surgery to maximize
            healing and prevent unnecessary strain on the body.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Initially, patients may have a surgical drain placed at the incision site to reduce swelling. This drain must be emptied and reset frequently to prevent a fluid buildup. Drains are
            typically removed a few days after surgery. The sutures will either dissolve in a couple of weeks or be removed along with any drains.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Most patients return to office jobs within one to two weeks following surgery, depending on the extent of the facelift. Bending, lifting and strenuous exercise will be off-limits for
            several weeks following a facelift. Patients should take great care to follow all recovery instructions to enhance the results of the procedure and help prevent complications.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Swelling will subside over the weeks and months following surgery and patients can expect to see final results in about six months to a year. Preliminary results will be visible after
            about six to eight weeks.
