              It happens suddenly—you're just going along living your life and then one day you look
              in the mirror and it's there. The dreaded double chin has appeared! Fortunately, there
              is no need to get upset. Your next step is looking into chin liposuction.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5">
              Called chin lipo for short, this procedure removes excess fat from beneath your chin.
              The process is minimally invasive but provides maximum results, delivering a dramatic
              new jawline contour. Perhaps the best news is that the fat cells removed during the
              procedure are gone for good. So long as you maintain a stable weight, your new chin
              will stay with you for many happy years.

              Jawline contouring with chin liposuction is a fairly short surgery, taking only about
              30 to 60 minutes. You may choose to be under general anesthesia for your procedure or
              opt for
              <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/body/awake-liposuction/">awake liposuction</a>,
              which uses a local anesthetic to keep you comfortable. At Mia Aesthetics, our
              experienced plastic surgeons perform chin lipo in a sterile environment using advanced
              techniques that provide extreme precision.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              During chin lipo, your surgeon makes a small incision under your chin or behind your
              ears. The chin area is flooded with a special fluid that plumps the fat for easier
              removal and further numbs the area. A thin tube called a cannula is then passed
              through the incision and used to remove excess, unwanted fat cells. After sculpting
              the area into a more pleasing shape, your surgeon closes your incision(s) and sends
              you home to rest and recover.

              To be a good candidate for double chin removal with liposuction, you should be free of
              significant medical issues that might complicate the procedure. It’s also best if you
              have good skin elasticity so that your skin can snap back into place rather than
              sagging after the excess fat is gone. There are skin tightening procedures such as
              <a href="/non-surgical/j-plasma-skin-tightening/">J-plasma</a> that can help if your
              skin elasticity isn’t perfect. Chin lipo might not be a good idea for you if you have
              medical issues that can interfere with healing, such as uncontrolled diabetes or
              hypertension. To that end, we do require smokers to quit before their procedure as the
              chemicals in cigarette smoke negatively impact the body’s healing ability. If severe
              skin laxity accompanies your double chin, a
              <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/face/neck-lift/"> neck lift </a>
              may provide you with better jawline contouring.
