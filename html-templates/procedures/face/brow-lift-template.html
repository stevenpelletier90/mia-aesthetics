              As we age, gravity pulls on our bodies, including on the brow. This sometimes results
              in sagging, which can make you look sad, tired, or even angry. If the brow droops low
              enough, it can also interfere with your peripheral vision. In this case, a brow lift
              is often paired with
              <a href="/cosmetic-plastic-surgery/face/eyelid-lift-blepharoplasty/"
                >blepharoplasty</a
              >
              (a surgical repair or lifting of the eyelids). You may also develop two vertical lines
              between your eyes as your brow droops, commonly called the "11s."

                and lines, restoring your face's neutral expression.</strong
              >
              The procedure works well for those at all stages, from early signs of aging to severe
              brow aging. A brow lift can also improve your vision if the sagging in your brow
              obstructs it.

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Your surgeon has several surgical techniques to choose from when performing a brow lift,
            and the one he selects will vary depending on the extent of the procedure and your
            wishes. The differences between each technique revolve primarily around incision
            placement. Usually performed under general anesthesia, the four possible surgical
            techniques used during a brow lift include:
          </p>
          <ul class="mb-3">
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Endoscopic:</strong> During an
              <a href="/what-is-an-endoscopic-brow-lift/">endoscopic brow lift</a>, the surgeon
              makes small, 1-inch incisions at your hairline. He then uses a small camera to help
              him visualize and manipulate his surgical instruments and work within your brow,
              suturing tissue in place. This procedure is minimally invasive, allowing for faster
              healing.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Direct/Mid-Forehead:</strong> The incisions for these techniques are made just
              above your eyebrows (direct) or within the furrows of your forehead (mid-forehead).
              This approach is rarer and used for patients with severe signs of aging. This
              procedure does work well for those with deep forehead creases and balding men for whom
              we can't hide the incisions in the hairline.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
              <strong>Coronal:</strong> Also known as an open brow lift, a coronal lift involves
              placing a single incision along the hairline from ear to ear. This approach is most
              often used for women with small foreheads, as this technique can lift the hairline.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-0">
              <strong>Temporal:</strong> A more minimal approach, the
              <a href="/what-is-a-temporal-brow-lift/">temporal brow lift</a> involves incisions at
              either side of the forehead and focuses on the outer third of the brow on either side.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb-0">
            No matter where your surgeon places his incisions, the overall goals and techniques of a
            brow lift remain the same. The surgeon will smooth and tighten the skin, adjust the
            muscles for a more youthful appearance, and make any other necessary changes before
            closing the incisions and putting bandages in place.

            After brow lift surgery, your forehead will be swollen and bruised. You should plan to
            take at least 10 to 14 days off work for initial healing, but you may need less time if
            you've had an endoscopic procedure. While recovering, rest often and keep your head
            elevated as much as you can.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Your surgeon will give you detailed instructions on how to care for your incisions. If
            your stitches need to be removed, he will schedule a time to remove them for you.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            You will need to resume your normal activities gradually, postponing strenuous
            activities for several weeks after surgery.
