              It can also make the eyes look bigger. Performed on the upper lid, lower lid, or both,
              an eyelid lift is often sought by both men and women for an assortment of reasons. An
              eyelid lift can correct the following issues:

              On the day of your surgery, your doctor will send you off to sleep using general
              anesthesia before getting to work. If he is working on your upper eyelid, he will make
              his incision along the natural crease or fold of your eyelid. He will remove any
              excess skin, muscle and fat as necessary and then close the incision using sutures,
              surgical tape, or adhesives.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              If your surgeon is repairing your lower lid, he will make his incision either just
              below your lash line or just inside your eyelid. Through this incision he will remove
              or redistribute extra fat and muscle as well as any sagging skin. Again, he will close
              the incision using the method he feels is best.

              Immediately after eyelid surgery, your doctor will apply a lubricating ointment to
              your eyes. This may cause your vision to be a bit blurry. This is perfectly normal and
              not a sign that something is wrong. You may also notice light sensitivity and double
              vision.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              You will experience swelling and bruising around the eyes, and your incisions may itch
              as they heal. You'll need to avoid rubbing your eyes even if they itch and avoid
              wearing contact lenses for at least 2 weeks.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Noticeable discomfort or swelling should subside within 48 hours, and we will
              prescribe pain medication to keep you comfortable. You'll need to keep your head
              elevated as much as possible and may find ice packs can help reduce swelling and
              discomfort the night of and day after your surgery.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              After one to two weeks, you can gradually resume normal activities like office work
              and light household chores. However, heavy lifting, exercise, and other strenuous
              activities need to be postponed for several more weeks.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              You'll begin to see the preliminary results from eyelid surgery in six to eight weeks,
              but your final results won't appear until about six months after surgery.

              Cosmetic surgery performed on the lower eyelid is permanent. It is extremely rare for
              a patient to need future surgeries in this area. The upper eyelid can start to droop
              again, however. Upper eyelid surgeries can last a lifetime, but some patients see new
              changes to their eyelids 5 to 7 years after the procedure.
