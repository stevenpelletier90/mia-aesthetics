              A mini facelift is a surgical procedure that reduces signs of aging for a more
              youthful, rejuvenated look. This particular surgery focuses on the lower portion of
              the face and jawline, allowing for fewer incisions and a faster recovery than a
              traditional facelift. It's also less expensive. Unlike dermal fillers, Botox, laser
              treatments, and other skin rejuvenation options, a mini facelift can easily last five
              to 10 years and doesn't require ongoing treatments.

              We know that although surgery is just part of the daily routine for us, it's anything
              but ordinary for you. Many of our patients express feelings of nervousness and anxiety
              prior to their procedures, and we do what we can to put them at ease. One of the best
              ways to do this is by making sure that you know what to expect when you come in for
              your procedure. To that end, here are the steps involved in a mini facelift:
            </p>
            <ol class="mb-4">
              <li class="mb-3">
                The first step for our patients at Mia Aesthetics is always a free virtual
                consultation. During this consultation we will assess whether you are a candidate
                for a mini facelift and answer any questions you may have about getting one.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                When you arrive on the day of your surgery, you'll be prepped for surgery and have a
                quick check-in with your surgeon. After that, we'll take you into the OR and place
                you under general anesthesia.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Once you're peacefully sleeping, your surgeon will start the procedure by making
                their incisions. For a mini facelift, doctors usually hide their incisions along the
                natural crease at the front of your ear. The cut may continue down around and behind
                the earlobe, if necessary, but it will still be well hidden.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Next your plastic surgeon will gently separate your skin from the underlying tissue
                and muscles. They will then tighten these muscles as needed to create the desired
                shape and contour.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                Your surgeon will then cut away any sagging, stretched, or excess skin.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                The remaining skin is smoothed over the lower portion of your face and pulled taut.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-4">
                Lastly, your incisions will be closed and any necessary dressings applied.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Your care team will monitor you as you wake up from the anesthesia and then send you
              home the same day as your surgery. Your surgeon will prescribe pain medication to keep
              you comfortable, but discomfort is generally mild after a mini facelift. You will
              manage swelling and bruising by applying icepacks to your face. You will also need to
              keep your incision sites clean and dry as they heal.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Your surgeon will schedule a follow-up appointment with you a few days after your
              surgery. It's important that you keep this appointment. It is when your stitches will
              be removed, if applicable, and allows your surgeon to check your progress and make
              sure you are healing well and without complications.
