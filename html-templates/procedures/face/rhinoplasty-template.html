              Rhinoplasty is a procedure that reshapes the nose. Patients may seek out rhinoplasty
              because they want a more symmetrical and harmonious facial appearance or a change in
              the overall shape and size of their nose. Some of the most common rhinoplasty requests
              include changing the size and position of nostrils, changing the shape of the nose tip
              or bridge and improving overall symmetry.

            <p class="fs-5 mb-0">
              Nasal surgery also corrects common breathing problems or birth defects that affect the
              nose, face and nasal passages. Correcting a deviated septum is the most common medical
              reason for a rhinoplasty. This involves changing the structure of the nasal passages
              to allow for easier airflow and breathing. It also involves careful evaluation of the
              current problems to be sure the changes will result in significant airflow
              improvement.

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Rhinoplasty is typically an outpatient procedure, allowing patients to return home the
            day of surgery. General Anesthesia keeps patients safe and comfortable during the
            procedure.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Incisions made in the procedure may be made entirely inside the nose, entirely outside
            the nose, or some combination of the two depending on the goals of the procedure.
            External incisions are generally made only across the narrow strip of tissue between the
            nostrils. It is highly unlikely that even external incision marks will be noticeable.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            The shape of the nose is altered by either removing or adding cartilage to the inside of
            the nose or reshaping the nasal bones. If cartilage must be added, the graft is most
            commonly taken from the middle of the nose (the septum), but it may also be taken from
            the ear if the nasal cartilage is not available. In rare cases, the cartilage may be
            taken from the rib. Taking these grafts may require separate incisions and anesthesia.
            The surgical plan is made in advance so that patients are aware of all the steps that
            will take place during the procedure.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            After the interior sculpting of the nose structure is complete, the incisions are
            closed. All of these steps can be done in a single procedure.

          <p class="mb-3">
            Initial recovery from rhinoplasty involves supporting the new nose structure while it
            heals with packing, bandages or splints. These supports are generally removed after a
            few weeks. Specific recovery times vary depending on the patient and particulars of the
            procedure.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Swelling and minor discomfort are the most common side effects of the procedure. This
            swelling may come and go over time and tends to be more severe in the morning. There may
            be mild pain, including a dull headache and a feeling of stuffiness or nasal congestion.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Full recovery from the surgery generally takes a year, though the majority of healing
            only takes a few months. During this prolonged recovery time, you may notice gradual
            changes in the shape of your nose as swelling subsides. It is important to keep in mind
            that the initial appearance of the nose right after surgery will probably not be the
            final appearance.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            It is important to keep the site clean, especially for the first few days after surgery.
            Patients should also be extremely careful and prevent bumping or damaging the nose for
            several weeks. Your nose will be very fragile while it recovers, and even a minor impact
            may alter the results of surgery. Overexertion after surgery can slow down healing or
            damage the nose. You may not be able to exercise normally or vigorously for a few weeks.
            You will also be prescribed various medications such as painkillers and antibiotics to
            help you recover and prevent infection.
