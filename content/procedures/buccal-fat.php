			<h2>What Is Buccal Fat Removal?</h2>
			<div class="lead-text mb-4">
			<p class="fs-5">
				Chubby cheeks are cute when you're a toddler, but they make a lot of adults feel
				extremely self-conscious.
			</p>
			<p class="fs-5">
				Buccal fat removal (cheek fat removal) is a plastic surgery procedure for reducing
				prominent cheeks. The goal of buccal fat removal surgery is to thin the cheeks,
				specifically in the area of the cheek hollows. The result is a thinner looking face
				and more accentuated cheekbones.

			<h2>About The Buccal Fat Removal Procedure</h2>
			</div>
			<p class="mb-3">
			During your buccal fat removal, your doctor will sedate you through intravenous sedation
			or general anesthesia.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
			Once you're sleeping comfortably, he will make an incision inside your mouth, on the
			inner portion of your cheek. Because the incision is in your mouth, you'll have no
			visible scarring after your surgery.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-0">
			Next, your surgeon will gently push on your cheeks, popping your buccal fat pad into
			your mouth through the incision. From there, your surgeon can extract the fat pad and
			trim it to the desired size before putting it back in place within your cheek. When the
			newly trimmed fat pad is safely tucked back in your cheek, your surgeon will close his
			incision and repeat the process on your other cheek.

			Healing will continue for several weeks, with the swelling steadily decreasing. Continue

			Not everyone is a good candidate for a buccal fat removal procedure. Even if you don't
			like your cheeks, you may not be able to have the procedure if your doctor determines
			them to be slim.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
			Age can also play a factor in surgery eligibility. As we age, the amount of buccal fat
			we have diminishes. If yours is starting to dwindle, you may not be a good candidate for
			surgery. Note too that although your cheeks may seem large now, removing buccal fat can
			make you appear to age faster when what you have left after surgery starts to disappear.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
			This is not a procedure to rush into and it's one you should thoroughly discuss with
			your surgeon.
