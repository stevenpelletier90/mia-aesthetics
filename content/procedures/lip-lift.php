              For the right candidates, lip lifts can permanently give the lips a fuller and more youthful appearance. Interestingly, the procedure improves the look of the lips without touching them.
              Instead, these lifts work by shortening the expanse of skin between the bottom of your nose and upper lip.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 mb-0">
              The result is a fuller, more proportionate smile with improved upper lip definition. When necessary, the procedure also serves to lift down-turned mouth corners and cover overly exposed
              teeth. And it does it all without changing the structure of your nose or vermilion (the red part of your lips).

            You may be feeling a bit skeptical at this point, wondering how our plastic surgeons improve your lips without touching them, but it can be done! Removing skin beneath the nose and pulling
            it tight naturally lifts the top lip. When done well, it creates a natural, fuller look. Here is a step-by-step overview of how it's done:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled mb-3">
            <li class="mb-2 d-flex align-items-start">

              <span>You are placed under general anesthesia or given a local anesthetic along with mild sedation, depending on your preference.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 d-flex align-items-start">
              <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check text-gold me-2 mt-1"></i>
              <span>Your plastic surgeon makes a small, well-hidden incision beneath your nose. The exact shape and location vary based on your specific needs.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2 d-flex align-items-start">
              <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check text-gold me-2 mt-1"></i>
              <span>We remove a small amount of skin. We're talking about removing just a few millimeters as opposed to doing something drastic.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-0 d-flex align-items-start">
              <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check text-gold me-2 mt-1"></i>
              <span
                >Next, we lift your upper lip and carefully suture it in place. The suturing process focuses on keeping (or creating) lip symmetry while utilizing stitching techniques that minimize
                scarring.</span
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mb-0">
            Your lip lift will take around 45 to 75 minutes to complete, depending on its complexity. You'll be able to go home the same day as your surgery, but you won't be able to drive yourself if
            you've had general anesthesia or sedation.

          Your plastic surgeon has several different incision shapes to choose from during a lip lift, including the Italian, central, and gullwing. They will be happy to discuss the specifics of your
          lift during your consultation, but we'll briefly touch on the two most common lip lift types, the bullhorn and corner lifts, here.

            <p class="mb-0">
              During this type of lift, your plastic surgeon will make an incision directly under your nose in the shape of a bull's horns. This is the most common and versatile type of lip lift, and
              it hides any post-op scarring beneath the nose. Plastic surgeons use the bullhorn lift to elevate the center of the upper lip, maintain a natural lip curvature, and increase the amount
              of tooth surface that shows when you speak and smile.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Corner Lip Lift</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Another common type of lip lift, the corner lift, is often combined with the bullhorn lift. Focusing on lifting the outer corners of your lips, this lift creates a softer, more upturned
              expression. If the corners of your lips turn down, or if your mouth always looks sad, the corner lip lift may work well for you.

          </div>
          <p class="mb-3">
            Today we're talking about lip lifts, but lip fillers are quite popular and better known. Upon learning about lifts, patients often wonder how they differ from filler. The main differences
            lie in their results and permanence.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-3">
            The two procedures don't accomplish the same things. Dermal fillers make the lips plumper and more voluminous. Lifts, on the other hand, physically alter the lip's position. Fillers are
            also temporary, requiring regular upkeep every few weeks to months. Fall behind on your filler injection schedule and your lips will fall too. Lip lift results are permanent, however.
            (We'll talk a bit later about what permanent means when it comes to plastic surgery.)
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">It's also worth noting that lip lifts avoid the potential complication of filler migration. This happens only rarely, but it can happen.</p>
