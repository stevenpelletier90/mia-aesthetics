			<div class="lead-text">
			<p class="fs-5 mb-0">
				Medically known as a platysmaplasty, a neck lift is a surgical tool used to correct wrinkles and sagging skin on the neck. These common signs of aging often create a condition that is
				less-than-lovingly referred to as a turkey neck. While a neck lift does address excess fat and skin, it also tightens a muscle in the neck known as the platysma muscle. This muscle
				becomes weaker and thinner as you age, which is often the underlying cause of a sagging neck. Added bonus—a neck lift can also eliminate the dreaded double chin.

			<p class="mb-3">
				The surgeons at Mia Aesthetics perform neck lifts as outpatient procedures under general anesthesia. You won't be allowed to drive yourself home because of the anesthesia, however, so
				you will need to have someone bring you to your surgery. A neck lift can take anywhere from one to four hours, so your ride will definitely want to bring a book!
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Now that your ride knows what to expect, you should too. After you are prepped for surgery and drift off to sleep under anesthesia, your neck lift will proceed as follows:
			</p>
			<ol class="mb-4">
				<li class="mb-3">Your surgeon will make a small incision behind each ear and, depending on your needs, may also make a third incision beneath your chin.</li>
				<li class="mb-3">Through these incisions, your surgeon will tighten the neck muscles and the underlying tissue.</li>
				<li class="mb-3">Excess skin and fat will be removed as needed to recontour and shape the neck.</li>
				<li class="mb-4">Your remaining skin will be pulled taut over your neck and then your incisions closed.</li>
			</ol>

			The specifics of your neck lift recovery will depend on the extent of the surgery and your unique healing rate. Typically, patients return to their daily activities and work about two
			weeks after surgery. Some patients notice a change in their profile quickly after a neck lift, but it can take a few months for the swelling to completely abate and allow you to see your
			final results.
			</p>
			<p>
			You will experience some swelling and bruising, which may not be symmetrical. Your neck may feel tight or stiff, as well, but this sensation will fade with time. Your plastic surgeon will
			send you home with a list of post-op instructions, and it's important that you follow them. Among other things, expect your surgeon to advise you to:
